# Shark
Swift Script that transforms the .xcassets folder into a type safe Enum.

> The master branch of Shark is Swift 3.0 compatible. For Swift 2 support, please check out the Swift2 branch.

### Blog Post & Tutorial
[http://kaandedeoglu.com/2015/07/28/Shark/](http://kaandedeoglu.com/2015/07/28/Shark/)

### Quick Setup:

#### Cocoapods:
- Add `pod 'Shark'` to your `Podfile`
- Go to your targets build phases and add a `Run Script Phase` and place it before the `Compile Sources` phase.
- Shark takes two parameters - path to your image assets (folder with the .xcassets extension), and the path to the desired output folder. Fill the run script area by typing these out. Here's an example: 

`"$PODS_ROOT/Shark/shark" "${PROJECT_DIR}/${PROJECT_NAME}/Assets.xcassets" "${PROJECT_DIR}/${PROJECT_NAME}"`


#### Manually
- Place `Shark.swift` anywhere in your project directory - you don't have to add it to your project or your targets.
- Go to your targets build phases and add a `Run Script Phase` and place it before the `Compile Sources` phase.
- Shark takes two parameters - path to your image assets (folder with the .xcassets extension), and the path to the desired output folder. Fill the run script area by typing these out. Here's an example: 

`"${PROJECT_DIR}/path_to_Shark.swift} "${PROJECT_DIR}/${PROJECT_NAME}/Assets.xcassets" "${PROJECT_DIR}/${PROJECT_NAME}"`


#### Building the executable yourself:
- Clone the repo
- Run the setup script from the terminal - `sh setup.sh`. This will compile the source, create an executable and move it to `/usr/local/bin`. After this, Shark is available from the command line as `shark`
- Go to your targets build phases and add a `Run Script Phase` and place it before the `Compile Sources` phase
- Shark takes two parameters - path to your image assets (folder with the .xcassets extension), and the path to the desired output folder. Fill the run script area by typing these out. Here's an example: 

`shark "${PROJECT_DIR}/${PROJECT_NAME}/Assets.xcassets" "${PROJECT_DIR}/${PROJECT_NAME}"`

#### Finally
Whichever method you chose, the final steps are the same, and they are outlined below:

- Build once - a file named `SharkImages.swift` should magically appear at your output destination.
- Add the file to your project.
- You're done! the file `SharkImage.swift` will be updated every time you build the project.

----

After the setup, we can use Shark to load images in two ways:

```swift
myImageView.image = UIImage(shark: Shark.EmptyIcons.programs_empty_icon)
```

```swift
myImageView.image = Shark.EmptyIcons.programs_empty_icon.image
```

### Notes
- Using nested folders makes working with Shark easier. This way you can do `Shark.Buttons.Active.Login.fb_button.image` rather than `Shark.fb_button.image` (which is harder to find when there are 100s of images in your assets)
- Name your images with valid enum case names ( `login_button` is valid whereas `login-button` or `login button` are not), Swift 2 automatically sets case names to raw values in String backed Enums. If you name your images with valid names - Shark will generate something like `case login_button`, otherwise you'll see something like `case "loginbutton = "login button"` 

### Sample `SharkImages.swift` file:

```swift
//SharkImageNames.swift
//Generated by Shark

import UIKit

    public var image: UIImage? {
        return UIImage(named: self.rawValue)
    }
}

    convenience init?<T: RawRepresentable>(shark: T) where T.RawValue == String {
        self.init(named: shark.rawValue)
    }
